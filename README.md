# TalkTown

This is a frontend for [TalkTown Backend](https://github.com/nightness/TalkTown-Backend); a OpenSource flexible chat system. It supports private, public, and group messages (with voice support coming soon). This client is built using React Native, more specifically Expo 41; supporting Android, iOS, and Web builds. The backend uses Firebase, for the easy setup; but support for MongoDB is in planning.

You can visit the live site @ [TalkTown Web App](https://talktown.live/)

## Setup

```
npm i -g expo-cli firebase-tools
yarn
```

## Configure

1. Setup a new (or use and existing) firebase project. I also recommend that you double check project settings right away.
2. Click on the 'web button' above the `Add an app to get started` text.
3. Give your app an arbitrary nickname and click the `Register App` button.
4. You'll need the object part in step 6.
5. Create a `private/` folder in the project's root folder
6. Create a `private/FirebaseAuth.ts` file that looks like this...

```tsx
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
export const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: '[API KEY]',
    authDomain: '[AUTH DOMAIN]',
    databaseURL: '[DATABASE URL',
    projectId: '[PRoJECT ID]',
    storageBucket: '[STORAGE BUCKET]',
    messagingSenderId: '[MESSAGE SENDER ID]',
    appId: '[APP ID]',
    measurementId: '[MEASUREMENT ID]',
}

// These can be found in google console under the API Credentials OAUTH2 section.
// You will have to create the expoClientID manually (it's a web credential type)...
//      Add URL: https://auth.expo.io
//      Authorized Redirects: https://auth.expo.io/@your-expo-username/your-project-name
export const androidClientId = '[ANDROID CLIENT ID]';
export const expoClientId = '[EXPO CLIENT ID]';
export const iosClientId = '[IOS CLIENT ID]';
export const webClientId = '[WEB CLIENT ID]';
```

7. From the CLI, in the project folder, type `firebase init` and setup hosting (This entire setup is optional if you just want to run locally)

## Startup

```
expo start
```
